      (that the heavens and the earth endure, except as your Lord wills:) The
      meaning of the exception that is made here is that the condition of
      eternal pleasure that they will experience therein is something that is
      not mandatory by itself. Rather, it is something that is dependent upon
      the will of Allah. Unto Him belongs the favor of immortality upon them.
      For this reason they are inspired to glorify and praise Him, just as they
      are inspired to breathe. Ad-Dahhak and Al-Hasan Al-Basri both said, "It is
      about the right of the disobedient people of Tawhid who were in the Fire
      and then brought out of it." Then Allah finished this statement by saying,
      (a gift without an end.) This means that it will never be cut off. This
      has been mentioned by Mujahid, Ibn `Abbas, Abu Al-`Aliyah and others. This
      has been mentioned so that the suspicious person will not doubt after the
      mention of the will of Allah. Someone may think that the mention of
      Allah's will here means that the pleasure of Paradise may end or change.
      To the contrary, it has been decreed that this pleasure will truly be
      forever and will never end. Likewise, Allah has clarified here that the
      eternal torment of the people of the Fire in Hell also is due to His will.
      He explains that He punishes them due to His justness and wisdom. This is
      why He says, (that the heavens and the earth endure, except as your Lord wills:) The

        <p>Every single one of their decisions is based upon moderation. Undue anger or harshness, which then sometimes swells into arrogance, is not present in their personality. There should also not be any undue elasticity within their nature, which translates into shamefulness and complacency. This does not pertain solely to the individual, but rather, should be present on a communal level as well, meaning, Allah s servants, as a community, should develop this trait. There also lies a prophecy concerning this [Quranic verse] that Allah servants will indeed meet with victory, and when they do, they should not be arrogant or egotistic. They should not seek vengeance or retribution and forget Allah the Almighty. Rather, they should focus on adopting humility and granting people their rights.</p>
